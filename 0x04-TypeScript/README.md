TypeScript is a strongly typed Object-Oriented open source programming language that builds on JavaScript. It is developed and supported by Microsoft. Actually, it is a strong superset of JavaScript and consists of all its segments. In simple terms, each JavaScript code is a valid TypeScript code, which means if anything is implemented in JavaScript by using TypeScript, you can add the enhanced features of your choice. 

By converting TypeScript into JavaScript, it will be much simpler to combine it into JavaScript projects. The methodology of TypeScript is very similar to OOPS, so a TypeScript code can be converted into JavaScript with the help of the TypeScript Compiler.
